	  This option enables Clang's Source-based Code Coverage.

	  If unsure, say N.

	  On a kernel compiled with this option, run your test suites, and
	  download the raw profile from /sys/kernel/debug/llvm-cov/profraw.
	  This file can then be converted into the indexed format with
	  llvm-profdata and used to generate coverage reports with llvm-cov.

	  Note that a kernel compiled with coverage flags will be significantly
	  larger and run slower.

	  Note that the debugfs filesystem has to be mounted to access the raw
	  profile.
